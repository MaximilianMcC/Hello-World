Write "Hello, world!" in Java👍


ngl java not even that bad a languege tbh🤷 bruh tbh idk I just got here lol🤣😂 anyway if i add a timer thingy then it only takes like 4ms like imo thats kinda good🥱 i actualuy took time out of my day *(i have a VERY busy schedule😤)* to see how long it takes in asm (assemebely) and i found [this website](https://montcs.bloomu.edu/Information/LowLevel/Assembly/hello-asm.html) with comic sans💪 anyways i read this ENTIRE website and it took me only like 2 minutes bruh asembely is a slow language😔 smh (shaking my head rn) o yeah also they did a fake hello world like they didnt have the "!" at the end🤢 so in conclusion java best language to learn 2014😼
